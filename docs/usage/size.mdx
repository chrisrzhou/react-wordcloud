# Size

By default, `ReactWordcloud` will inherit its parent container's size unless an explicit `size` prop is specified.

## Responsive parent size

This is the default behavior. You can resize the Playground container to watch the wordcloud update when parent size changes.

<Playground>
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: "#efefef", height: "100%", width: "100%" }}>
    <ReactWordcloud words={words} />
  </div>
</Playground>

## Explicit size values

Provide explicit values with the `size` prop. The wordcloud will no longer respond to resizing.

<Playground>
  <ReactWordcloud words={words} size={[400, 400]} />
</Playground>

## Minimum size

The `d3-cloud` layout algorithm requires valid `size` and `fontSize` to be provided. Providing a value that is zero or low will incur long and potentially infinite computations.

You can customize the minimum size by adjusting the `minSize` prop. If the provided `size` or resized values are smaller than the `minSize`, it will use the `minSize` value, as demonstrated in the following example:

<Playground>
  <ReactWordcloud words={words} minSize={[200, 150]} size={[100, 100]} />
</Playground>
