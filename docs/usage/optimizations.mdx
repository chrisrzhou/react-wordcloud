# Optimizations

> [BETA] Note that this feature is not formally supported, but is made available for improving performance in edge cases.

By default, `react-wordcloud` uses the [`d3.cloud`](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud) layout algorithm. The algorithm as of [v1.2.5](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud/releases/tag/v1.2.5) is not optimized to handle rendering larger `words`.

An optimized solution was explored by [WhoAteDaCake](https://github.com/WhoAteDaCake) in [#33](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/react-wordcloud/pull/33), and can be accessed by setting `options.enableOptimizations` to `true`. This feature is marked as `beta` and will be more formally supported if the underlying `d3-cloud` algorithm supports it.

This section shows how multiple wordclouds are rendered smoothly with `enableOptimizations` set to `true`.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  {Array(12).fill().map((_v, i) => (
    <div key={i} style={{ height: 400, width: 300 }}>
      <ReactWordcloud options={{ enableOptimizations: true }} words={words} />
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
