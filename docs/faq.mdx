# FAQ

## Why are some words dropped?

`ReactWordcloud` applies a limit that can be controlled by the `maxWords` prop. This is set to `100` by default. You can raise the limit but be careful that this could affect performance.

## Why is the most frequent word is not showing up?

This issue happens when the most frequent word is also the **longest** word. For a given wordcloud size, if the longest and most frequent word does not fit in the wordcloud SVG container, the `d3-cloud` algorithm drops them out. This is a known issue discussed in: https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud/issues/36

`react-wordcloud` tries to solve this issue by recursively rendering the wordcloud if it detects that words have been dropped out. Each recursion would decrease the applied font-size by a scale factor. The recursion will bail out after some maximum attempts is reached, and a console warning will be thrown to the user informating that the words cannot be rendered in the wordcloud. The following example below demonstrates this scenario:

<Playground>
  <ReactWordcloud
    size={[200, 200]}
    words={[
      { text: "this_is_a_long_word_and_also_the_most_frequent", value: 45 },
      { text: "some_word", value: 35 },
      { text: "another_word", value: 20 }
    ]}
  />
</Playground>

If you see this console warning, it is recommended that you address it in the following few common ways:

- Increase the wordcloud size (either using the `size` prop or the parent container).
- Reduce the `options.fontSizes` values.
- Avoid rendering long words at vertical angles (i.e. 90 degrees). Browser heights are more limited than widths, and the long words may not fit within the wordcloud height. You can control rotation angles using `rotationAngles` and `rotations` in the `options` props.
